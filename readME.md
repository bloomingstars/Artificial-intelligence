# Design and implement network graphs : Prolog
Created a prolog style database with facts and rules representing information in text sentences
The code can be compiled in https://swish.swi-prolog.org/ : used to validate inferences from the network graphs

# Novel Heuristic A*, RBFS, DFS implementation.
Implemented Euclidean distance and spherical distance heuristics to calculate the most efficient route between 2 cities
Devised a novel heuristic to find the most efficient route.
Performed analysis of the 3 heuristics(Euclidean, spherical and my own heuristics) using : final path length, maximum length of queue while path formation. 
	

# NLP based SVC model text classification
Trained word to vec model to represent each word in a sentence.
Trained SVC classifier to use the word-2-vec representations to classify a message as ham or spam.
